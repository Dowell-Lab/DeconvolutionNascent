# Generation of Bidirectionals

Bidirectional regions called by dREG and Tfit were merged using muMerge version 1.1.0 (https://github.com/Dowell-Lab/mumerge) \cite{Rubin2021transcription}. Since muMerge combines regions in a probabilistic way, replicate information and sample conditions were taken into account for the merging processes. Tfit and dREG bidirectional transcript calls were first muMerged separately by paper based on the experimental setup (that is by cell/tissue type, experimental condition, and replicate information). The criteria used was the same as shown in the original muMerge paper \cite{Rubin2021transcription}; where joint distribution for each region was calculated such that the product of replicate distributions was taken, then the sum of the resulting distributions was taken across the different experimental conditions.

The paper muMerge bed files were then combined based on the cell/tissue types for Tfit and dREG, where the same cell/tissue types were treated as "replicates" and the different cell/tissue types were the ""conditions". The selection of papers to merge was based on the percent of calls overlapping TSS, the GC content of the 300bp regions around the center of the calls, and the paper QC. Samples from 101 human papers were used for the final mumerge step. Lastly, the dREG and Tfit muMerge files were combined such that Tfit calls were used for overlapping dREG and Tfit regions.
